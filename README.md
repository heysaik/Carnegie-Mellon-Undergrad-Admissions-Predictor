# Carnegie-Mellon-Undergrad-Admissions-Predictor
This Neural Network, written using TensorFlow, can be used to determine your chance of getting into Carnegie Mellon based on GPA and a 2400 SAT score!

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Tensorflow

## How it Works
As a beginner in Machine Learning, this is a really simple neural network! Takes in your GPA and SAT score and can give your chance of getting into Carnegie Mellon. After training on a dataset of GPA and SAT data, it can predict admissions.

## TODO
While this only works for Carnegie Mellon, I am in the process of acquiring the corpus from other various universities like MIT, Stanford, etc. I would like to expand this to be applicable for all colleges in general! Any pull requests are greatly appreciated!
